By filling out and agreeing to the terms of this application for ordination, you become ordained to perform weddings for friends, family, and other members of your community. North Shores Ministries is committed to making marriage accessible to all, regardless of race, gender, sexuality, or economic class. We are excited that you are considering joining us in this effort.

In addition to free online ordination, we encourage you to take advantage of our extensive wedding training and preparation tools available on this website. As a minister of North Shores Ministries, you enjoy the same legal rights afforded to other ministers, rabbis, and imams across the United States.

Your purchase of ordination packages, books, and other items on our website allows us to continue to provide free ordination, and engage in advocacy for our ministers across the US.
