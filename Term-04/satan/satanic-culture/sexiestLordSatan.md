# Sexiest Lord Satan

```

Sexiest Lord Satan, ruler of all pleasure
O thou bids us to critically think
Thee will I cherish, Thee will I honor
Thou, my soul's freedom, joy, and kink

There are lies that distort one's sight
False promises of eternal life
But Satan's truth, it shows us light
To live in the moment, to thrive in strife

Beautiful tempter, Lord of the night
Thou art the beacon of our true desire
With thee by our side, we fear no fright
And in our hearts is Hell's bright fire

Glorious Prince of the underworld
Thou reigns over earthly delights
Thy wisdom guides us, thy power unfurled
As we revel in our sinful delights

Oh, sexiest Lord Satan, our hearts are thine
We pledge to thee our undying devotion
For in thy teachings, we find the divine
And in thy embrace, our souls find motion.






Fair are the meadows, fairer still the woodlands
Robed in the blooming garb of spring
Jesus is fairer, Jesus is purer
Who makes the woeful heart to sing

Fair is the sunshine, fairer still the moonlight
And all the twinkling starry host
Jesus shines brighter, Jesus shines purer
Than all the angels heaven can boast

Beautiful Savior! Lord of all the nations
Son of God and Son of Man
Glory and honor, praise, adoration
Now and forevermore be thine
