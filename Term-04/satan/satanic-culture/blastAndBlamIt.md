# Blast and Blam It

By Jonathan A. McCormick, Jr. 05 May 2023.

To the tune of "Be Our Guest" from Disney's "Beauty and the Beast".

A song to express frustration. To be taken METAPHORICALLY. 

```
Blast and blam it. Satan damn it
Cram and ram and wham and slam it
Tie a noose around its neck, scary
Yeet it into a tar pit

...
```
