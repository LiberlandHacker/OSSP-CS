```
Satan loves me, this I know,
For myself I stand and grow.
Through the shadows, I advance,
Rising above my circumstance.

Refrain:
Yes, Satan loves me,
Yes, Satan loves me,
Yes, Satan loves me,
He opens my eyes to know.

Satan, the infernal name,
Gets more than his share of blame.
He doesn't make you do a thing;
He crowns you as your own king.

Refrain:
Yes, Satan loves me,
Yes, Satan loves me,
Yes, Satan loves me,
He opens my eyes to know.

In this world of endless lies,
I will seek and I will rise.
I am master of my fate,
With the power to create.

Refrain:
Yes, Satan loves me,
Yes, Satan loves me,
Yes, Satan loves me,
He opens my eyes to know.

No more fear, no more shame,
With Satan I am not the same.
In my soul is Hell's bright fire,
Leading me to my own desire.

Refrain:
Yes, Satan loves me,
Yes, Satan loves me,
Yes, Satan loves me,
He opens my eyes to know.

Satan, who is much maligned,
Wants for us all to be kind.
In others' minds, we can illumine,
What it means to be a good human.

Refrain:
Yes, Satan loves me,
Yes, Satan loves me,
Yes, Satan loves me,
He opens my eyes to know.
