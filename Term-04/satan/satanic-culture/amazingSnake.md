# Amazing Snake

Amazing Snake, How sweet the fruit, Of the Forbidden Tree
I once was chained, but now I'm free, was blind but now I see

Lucifer has enlightened me, The Bright and Morning Star
He opened my eyes so I may see the way things really are

Twas sin that taught my heart to fear, And sin my fears relieved
How precious did that sin appear, The night I first perceived

Amazing Snake, who offered up, The fruit that set us free 
Thou bids us claim our liberty, And seek autonomy

Through flesh and mind, we celebrate, Our free will to explore 
No dogma binds, nor fetters tight, We seek truth to implore

Amazing Snake, thy wisdom vast, Has shown us paths to take
We value reason and inquiry, And the knowledge we can make

Through science, art, and intellect, We seek to break new ground 
And revel in the pleasure of, The senses that surround

Amazing Snake, thy gift to us, Is joy and ecstasy 
We celebrate the sacredness, Of life and all we see

We revel in our earthly forms, And pleasures we can find 
We take delight in all our senses, And in our carnal mind

So let us lift our heads up high, And celebrate with glee 
The freedom that our Snake has brought, To live and to be free
