```
In the shadows he dwells,
A being dark and feared,
But in his heart there swells,
Qualities to be revered.

For Satan, prince of night,
Has traits that we should cherish,
Though he's shrouded in fright,
His virtues should not perish.

He's a rebel, bold and free,
Unbound by convention's chains,
His spirit soars and he sees,
Beyond society's mundane.

He's a champion of the self,
And individuality,
Encouraging us to delve,
Into our own vitality.

He's an advocate of knowledge,
And the pursuit of truth,
He challenges us to acknowledge,
Our fears and apprehensions, uncouth.

He's a symbol of resilience,
And perseverance in the face of strife,
Teaching us the importance,
Of continuing to strive.

So let us not demonize,
This figure of the night,
For in his heart there lies,
Lessons that can guide us to the light.
