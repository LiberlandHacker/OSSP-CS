# Managing Risk When Driving

Risk is a part of life. But there are many things that can be done to reduce the levels of risk that we must deal with. 

Younger, less experienced drivers are at heightened risk of crashes. 

Even advanced drivers may encounter situations that are challenging.

Drivers must continually assess the situation and take appropriate actions to reduce risk. They must also follow the traffic laws and stay in control of their vehicles under all road conditions. They must also be aware and respond to the various people and objects in their environment. 

About 1/2 of all new drivers get a traffic offense or a crash within their first 12 months. It can take 5 years for a new driver to obtain "average" skill. 

60% of teens who died in motor vehicle crashes were NOT wearing a seat belt.

Newbie drivers are 4x as likely to crash, compared to experienced drivers.

Risk factors for driving include
* Age
* Gender
* Driving experience

It can be easy to overestimate one's driving abilities. This can lead to bolder driving, which can heighten risk.
