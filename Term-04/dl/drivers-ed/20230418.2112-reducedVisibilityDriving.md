# Reduced Visibility Driving

Make sure that YOU are always visible to other drivers. Turn on headlights.

Ensure you have lines of sight on all sides.

If needed, defrost/windshield wipe.

## Sight-Distance Rule

You must be able to stop within the distance that you are able to see. 

## Clean 
* lights
* Windows
* Mirrors

## Weather

If the weather gets SO BAD that you literally cannot see the edge of the road, 
then safely pull over, preferably as far as possible from the road and behind a 
guardrail or other stationary object to protect you from the risk of a future pileup. 
Turn on your emergency flashers. Wait it out. Resume driving when conditions improve enough 
to drive safely.
