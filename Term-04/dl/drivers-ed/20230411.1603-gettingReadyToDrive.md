# Getting Ready to Drive: Getting Acquainted with Your Vehicle

Establish good driving habits. This includes pre-drive checks.

## Pre-Driving Checks

Before driving, check that the vehicle is safe to operate. 
Make any useful adjustments to the seat, mirrors, etc. to 
optimize your comfort, capability, and situational awareness.

Make sure all occupants (including yourself) are properly secured with seat belts. 

Look for movement. Make sure other drivers see you.

## Pre-launch inspection
1. Under vehicle
    1. Check for objects that could interfere with operation.
    2. Check for leaking fluids or detached parts.  
2. Around vehicle
    1. Make sure that you have a clear path of travel.
    2. Make sure nothing is about to enter your immediate path of travel. Children are particularly at risk of being killed by backing vehicles.
3. On vehicle
    1. Tire damage
    2. Lights/signals/reflectors
    3. Windows
    4. Mirrors
    5. Wipers

    1. Confirm seats and trunk don't have any stowaways. This is important to prevent carjacking and other dangers.
