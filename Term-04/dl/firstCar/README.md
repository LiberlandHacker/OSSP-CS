### Maintenance
Regular maintenance is essential to keep your car running smoothly. Follow the manufacturer's 
recommended maintenance schedule and have your car serviced regularly. Regular maintenance 
includes oil changes, tire rotations, brake inspections, and fluid checks.

### Cleaning

1. Preparation: Before starting to clean your car, make sure you have all the necessary materials such as a bucket, car wash soap, a hose, microfiber towels or a chamois, and a tire cleaner.
2. Rinse the car: Use a hose to rinse the entire car thoroughly to remove any loose dirt and debris.
3. Clean the wheels and tires: Apply tire cleaner to the wheels and tires and use a tire brush to scrub them clean. Rinse thoroughly.
4. Wash the car: Fill a bucket with car wash soap and water. Dip a microfiber towel or wash mitt into the solution and wash the car from top to bottom, making sure to rinse the towel frequently to avoid scratching the paint. Rinse the car thoroughly.
5. Dry the car: Use a chamois or microfiber towel to dry the car thoroughly, starting from the top and working your way down.
6. Polish and wax: Apply a polish or wax to protect the car's paint and give it a shiny finish.
